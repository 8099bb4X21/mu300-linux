# luci-app-mu300

A self-contained LuCI application for Unisoc cellular devices. It provides the
dashboard, live radio readings, persistent network/band/cell/EN-DC locks, a
guarded AT terminal and an SMS UI.
The Device Management page controls USB role and gadget network policy, and
lists host-side USB network adapters for optional attachment to the LAN bridge.

The dashboard follows LuCI's selected language (English, Turkish, or Simplified
Chinese) without an extra language package. Its colors follow Aurora's existing
tokens when present, or the official Bootstrap theme's light/dark tokens.
The package also ships native LuCI menu catalogs (`lmo/`), so its top-level
menu and submenu remain translated on unrelated LuCI pages where the dashboard
JavaScript is not loaded. The corresponding editable source is in `po/`.

The package does not start or own the modem. Platform-specific access is behind
small command adapters, so the LuCI and RPC code does not need to change for a
different Unisoc OpenWrt firmware.

The own-number field is queried on every full cellular collection (normally
every five seconds while the dashboard is active), first with CNUM and then
with the IMS public identity if needed. It is not stored in the six-hour static
SIM identity cache: a missing startup value can recover on the next full
round. The existing serialized AT adapter is used; fast signal-only rounds
never query the number and no additional polling worker is started.

## AT adapters

Configure `/etc/config/unisoc_modem`:

- `at_backend=mu300` uses an existing `mu300-at` daemon and keeps its locking.
- `at_backend=atinout` uses the configured `at_port` and a package-local lock.
  Use this only when no other process reads that tty.
- `at_backend=custom` runs the executable in `at_command`. It receives
  `TIMEOUT` and the complete `AT COMMAND` as its two arguments. A platform that
  already has a RIL/AT daemon should expose it through this adapter so every
  client shares that daemon's lock.
- `at_backend=auto` prefers `mu300-at`, then `atinout`, then the custom command.

The SMS page uses `sms_command`, whose CLI contract is the existing
`mu300-sms` interface: `list`, `show`, `send`, `delete` and `sync`. This keeps
SIM storage details out of LuCI and lets each firmware supply its own adapter.

## SMS forwarding

The separate SMS forwarding page offers HTTPS webhook, DingTalk, TLS-verified
SMTP and local-SIM SMS destinations, plus optional device information, a device
note, phone/keyword blocklists, power notifications and a confirmed test send.
The feature is off by default. Its procd worker reads the local SMS pool only;
it does not open an AT port, invoke a SIM sync or delay boot. On first enable or
channel change it records the current pool ID before accepting new messages.
It stores each message's progress before delivery, so a restart or failed
delivery cannot replay old SMS. Blocked SMS are marked processed as well.

The adapter records `source: direct` for live `+CMT` delivery and `source: sim`
for SIM imports. `received` is the local insertion time, not proof of a new SMS.
SIM imports (including legacy records without `source`) are forwarded only if
their original `scts` is at or after the enable/channel-change barrier. This
retains delayed synchronization of new messages without mailing pre-enable
SIM history. SCTS must include its UTC offset: AT `yy/mm/dd,hh:mm:ss+qq`
(quarter-hours), or PDU `YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss+hh:mm`. Unknown dates and undecoded
SIM PDUs remain in the inbox but are not automatically forwarded. Direct
delivery uses its local insertion time, allowing delayed SMSC delivery.
This does not change transport failures: failed SMTP/webhook submissions are
reported but are not automatically retried.

The template language (Chinese, English or Turkish) is saved independently of
the browser session and used for message subjects, generated text, device-info
labels, tests and power notifications. Until saved, the editor offers the current
UI language; older configurations keep Chinese output. Original SMS bodies,
sender IDs, device notes and webhook JSON keys are never translated. SMTP
subjects use UTF-8 RFC 2047 encoding.

Private settings and replay state are in
`/etc/unisoc-modem/forward/` (0700 directory, 0600 files); passwords never
appear in the editor response or routine status polling. The package requires
`curl`, `msmtp`, a CA bundle and `openssl-util` for the TLS destinations. The source-tree
TF rootfs builder installs those tools explicitly. The SMS adapter must expose
a persistent `msg/` pool with the `next_id` and message-header format used by
`mu300-sms`; a different firmware can supply that adapter via
`unisoc_modem.main.sms_pool` and `sms_command`.

Power notifications are selectable only if a real `battery` power-supply
reports presence, capacity and charge state. Battery-less F50 builds leave
this option unavailable rather than forwarding the SC27xx fuel gauge's
unreliable phantom reading. The local SMS path is limited to one 70-unit
UCS-2 part by the existing MU300 adapter. There is no daily forwarding quota.

Network interface and state paths are also configured in the same UCI section;
none of the web code requires `sipa_eth0`, `wan`, `br-lan` or `/opt/mu300` from
the host firmware.

## Data plan accounting

The data-plan page records the selected cellular WAN interface's RX/TX byte
counters in an independent ucode/uloop worker. It samples every ten seconds
without opening AT channels or running a shell per sample. The dashboard reads
the worker's atomic RAM snapshot, so its refresh rate does not drive accounting.
The interface follows the existing adapter settings and netifd by default; a
device override is available for other firmware layouts.

Settings include a plan name, monthly-cycle and daily-reference allowances in
decimal GB, RX/TX/combined accounting, and a monthly reset day from 1 to 31.
Short months clamp the reset to their last day, in the device timezone. A usage
adjustment can account for traffic consumed before installing the plugin; it
expires at the next cycle and does not alter measured day/month history. Quotas
display usage warnings only and do not disconnect the network.

The worker retains 93 daily and 24 calendar-month buckets, showing the latest
31 days and 12 months. It checkpoints to `/etc/unisoc-modem/traffic/state.json`
every 60 seconds and at a clean stop; abrupt power loss can lose recent unsaved
samples. Package upgrades leave the database intact, and a sysupgrade keep rule
includes it. Initial activation establishes a baseline rather than inventing
earlier daily history. Counter resets and interface recreation are handled;
statistics are local estimates and may differ from carrier billing.

Accounting boundary tests can run on OpenWrt with:
`TZ=UTC0 ucode -L /usr/libexec/unisoc-modem tests/traffic_core.uc`.

## Persistent locks

The package owns `/etc/init.d/unisoc-modem-ui`. It starts a non-blocking procd
worker at boot only when saved locks exist and automatic application is enabled.
The worker probes the selected AT adapter every two seconds and replays the
settings immediately when it becomes ready. It never delays OpenWrt startup and
stops after `replay_timeout` seconds instead of polling forever. A platform
with a pre-radio hook may create `/run/unisoc-modem-early-hook-pending` before
AT startup. While that file exists, this worker sends no AT probes, preserving
the platform's first-command handshake. The platform removes it after its
radio-on attempt; if early replay did not create the completion marker, the
worker falls back to the normal late replay.

The portable worker activates saved mode/band/cell settings with one bounded
SFUN restart and raises the configured data interface afterwards. An EN-DC-only
replay needs no stack restart and is applied immediately. A platform with a
deliberate pre-radio integration may call
`/usr/libexec/unisoc-modem/lock replay early` from that hook after the AT
handshake and while the radio is off. Early replay reads back the saved fields
before writing its completion marker. A failed readback leaves late replay
available; a successful marker prevents duplicate application. `early` is
deliberately not a user-selectable setting because it is only safe at that exact
point in the platform radio sequence.

## USB device management

USB role defaults to device at every boot. The page can switch it immediately;
checking host auto-apply asks the package's boot worker to reapply host mode
at every boot. On the battery-less F50, the plugin writes the requested role
to sysfs directly: USB management disappears and an attached adapter may need
an externally powered hub. U30 Air uses `mu300-usb` and its charger boost/VBUS
checks. Other hardware can use the sysfs fallback or configure
`unisoc_modem.usb.role_command` with a platform-specific executable that
accepts `host` or `device`. The plugin must not bypass a known platform's
power-safety checks.

NCM/ECM/RNDIS selection is stored in `/etc/unisoc-modem/usb-boot.conf` only
when "Enable selected protocol" is checked. The optional TF-platform hook in `boot/init`
reads that file from the mounted TF root before gadget enumeration; other OpenWrt builds can
implement the same two-line `mode=...`/`scope=...` contract at their own early
gadget setup point. The plugin itself owns the policy and UI, not the kernel
or gadget. `once` is consumed after a successful boot only if initramfs
recorded that it applied the selection; subsequent boots use the platform's
default NCM. Selecting persistent host mode automatically disables USB
network auto-apply. While the current role is host, network-mode controls are
disabled. The backend validates the same rules regardless of UI state.
The TF boot implementation exposes RNDIS as a single USB configuration with
the ACM console; Windows does not bind a composite RNDIS adapter when the
device offers both RNDIS and NCM configurations. On LAN handoff, the temporary
initramfs IPv4 address is removed from `rndis0` so only `br-lan` owns it.

USB adapter discovery uses the USB sysfs parent of each network device. On
refresh it attempts to bring discovered devices up. “Add to LAN” adds only a
verified USB adapter to the configured LAN bridge device's UCI port list,
commits `network`, and reloads networking. The selected port is reattached
on USB netdev hotplug and LAN ifup, without a polling daemon or another
network reload. The action is idempotent and only available in host mode.

## Build

Copy this directory alone to `package/luci-app-mu300` in any compatible OpenWrt
buildroot, select `LuCI -> Applications -> luci-app-mu300`, and build normally.
No file outside this directory is copied into the package; platform-specific AT
and SMS implementations are discovered only through the documented adapters at
runtime.

For a source-tree hot install (without an `.ipk`/`.apk`), copy `root/` to `/`,
`htdocs/` to `/www/`, and `lmo/` to `/usr/lib/lua/luci/i18n/`; then
make `/etc/init.d/unisoc-modem-ui`, `/usr/libexec/rpcd/mu300dash` and the
`/usr/libexec/unisoc-modem/*` adapters executable; then
enable/start `unisoc-modem-ui` and
restart `rpcd`. Copying only `root/` leaves the LuCI menu visible but makes
`/luci-static/resources/view/mu300/*.js` return HTTP 404. Normal package
installation performs both copies through this package's `install` recipe.
